Hi! I've just launched a website that I think may be suitable for you: TheQBCarousel.com. The home page describes how it works in detail, but basically it’s a platform for predicting the starting QB of each NFL team in the following season. Obviously the Colts have been an active participant with the carousel in recent seasons, so I thought your followers might be interested in predicting the future. If you’re interested, I could help get you get setup with a private leaderboard for your followers and even some stats about who your followers think will be the starting QB at various point of the offseason. Let me know what you think!
