Introducing: The QB Carousel

Body:

TheQBCarousel.com
Over the last few years, the number of QBs switching teams in the off-season has been increasing. From one season to the next, as many as 50% of teams in the NFL have a new starting QB in Week 1.
TheQBCarousel.com is a platform that gives users the ability to record their predictions for who will be the starting quarterback at each NFL franchise in the following season.
Join or start a private leaderboard to compare your predictions to your friends. Once the 2023 season begins (and the starting QBs have been revealed) a global leaderboard will open so you can compare yourself to all other users.
